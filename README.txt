Basics: Go to the sample code folder and check helloSim.logo. I made a simple program where a species of agents is able to freely move, eat, reproduce and die in a grid-like world. I thoroughly annotated my code, but if y'all need better explanations just go to lib->NetLogo5.10 -> userManual. The hello world program example is in page 49.

Why netLogo: I understand that this language may come as complicated at first and as a potential roadblock on this project. However, after playing around with their sample models, it became clear to me that this library is absurdly powerful at creating vast complex simulations at a short period of time. Some of the projects that we did before on this class are also present on the Sample Models folder in netLogo format. If you analyze the code you will understand how simple it is to create models that took us days to build while allowing the observer to effortlessly change parameters on the simulation and automatically creating visualizations and plots.

TL;DR: All of the barebones that we need for simulation are here so we can worry about more complex stuff. Simple.Efficient. Plenty of examples. Most mentioned simulation software on google and Quora. You can make basically anything with this and link several modules combined.
