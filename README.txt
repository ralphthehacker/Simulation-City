After a long discussion, we decided to build our model from the ground up in Java.  We'd rather have the satisfaction of doing everything scratch than building on top of a robust piece of software.  

Checkpoint 1
------------
For this week, we intend to create the basic classes and software hierarchy.  Lawrence will get the ball rolling by making an outline of the classes, and Ralph and Sal will flesh those classes out and add on with the necessary methods and supporting classes.

Checkpoint 2
------------
For this week, we planned to have a fully running simulation. We finished the businesses, hiring and firing employees, looking for new jobs, and the state machine representation. The simulation is now functional. However, we only did superficial testing. We will spend next week testing the app and thinking about how to visualize the data.
