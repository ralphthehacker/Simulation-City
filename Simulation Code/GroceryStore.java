/**
 * This class represents a grocery store
 * A grocery store has a quality and price component, as well as the quantity of the produce.  
 * The first two combined dictate how much the store influences the contentment of a person. 
 * Also something to consider is how a grocery store interacts with the dynamic of the enviornment.  
 * If the store consistently runs out of food, it increases, or if it has too much,
 * it closes.  Something to consider down the line
